                <h1>What are business services?</h1>
                <p style="width:400px;">Business services refer to the activities that help organizations but
                     do not necessarily result in a physical commodity. This means that the 
                     value of each service is intangible. When a company needs to outsource labor 
                     that may not fall under its expertise or capability, it relies on business services
                      to provide that labor. Business services allow a company to focus on its specific goals
                       and hire internal employees for that purpose while hiring business service professionals
                        to complete tasks that need special expertise or equipment.</p>
